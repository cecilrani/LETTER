  <h1>Dear You 💗</h1>

  <p>
    You’re not just the person I love —  
    you’re the place my mind goes when I need love,  
    care, peace, hope, and everything, di thango.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’re not just the person I love —  
    you’re the place my mind goes when I need *you*.
  </p>

  <p id="hiddenText" class="hidden">
    Even on the days when words fail me,  
    know this — my love for you never does.<br><br>

    You are my favorite feeling,  
    my safest thought,  
    and my greatest blessing.<br><br>

    I don’t want a future that doesn’t include  
    your laugh, your touch,  
    your presence beside me.<br><br>

    Loving you is my favorite truth,  
    the one I’ll never get tired of living.<br><br>

    Even when we’re apart,  
    my heart knows exactly where it belongs —  
    with you.<br><br>

    I want to grow old with you,  
    collecting lots of memories,  
    holding hands,  
    and choosing each other every single day.<br><br>

    <strong>LOVE YOU SOO MUCH DI PISASU 💖</strong>
